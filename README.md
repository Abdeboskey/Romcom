# RomCom


This project was the first paired-programming project for Turing School of Software and Design's Front-End-Engineering program in Mod 1 of the 2005 inning. The project was designed to get us familiar with with using object-oriented-programming, querySelectors(), eventListeners, and linking between JavaScript, HTML and CSS files in a repository.

Romcom is a website that can generate random romantic novel covers from a pre-existing database, and can also allow users to input their own information to make custom covers and add to the database. Users can save covers to a collection, display that collection by toggling different page views, and delete covers from their collection by double-clicking on them.

### Functionality and application:

* From the homepage, users can click the Show New Random Cover button, and the website will pull a random cover image, title, and two random descriptors from a pre-existing database to be displayed on screen as a romantic novel cover.
